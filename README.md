<h1>Hale Anana - Resume </h1>
<hr>
I wanted to create a resume website to:
<ul>
<li> Showcase my skill and how its applied </li>
<li> Attract potential employers </li>
<li> To potentially collaborate with other web designers on cool and exciting project</li>
<ul>
<hr>
<h2>UX </h2>
As I've mentioned, this website is mainly targeted at potential employers. I focused on something simple and easy to navigate but made sure that it showcases what I'm capable of visually and technically.

During my research of what a good online resume should present, I found the following:

<ul>

<li> Simple and easy to navigate</li>
<li> Just  the right amount of information </li>
<li> Colour scheme should be pleasing and should not contradict</li>
<li> Uniformity of fonts, colours and themes</li>
<ul>

Putting myself in the employers position, I would probably go with the "less is more" approach.
The webpage has all the information that a potential employer/collaborator needs.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

In this current version, my main feature is the collapsable navigation bar. All content of the website will scale to whatever device the user is viewing it on.
The navbar background when viewed on smaller screen was initially visually unappealing so I made sure that when scaled to smaller screens, the navbar background disappears and blends in the photo.


<h3>Features Left to Implement<</h3>
I would like to add a "Portofolio" page once I have enough projects to showcase.
I also intend to add animated feautures once I become proficient at JS ,Python and etc.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML- To create the structure of the website</li>
<li>CSS - To add styles and make my website visually appealing</li>
<li>Bootstrap- Provides ready to use and visually appealing classes for convenience. Saves a lot of time </li>
<li>Figma- To create the wireframe of my website</li>
</ul>


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
